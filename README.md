## Costs
You'll pay for the AWS resources you use with this architecture but since that will depend on your level of usage we'll compute an estimate of the base cost of this architecture (this will vary from region to region).

Key Assumptions:
- Work week: 40 hours (8 hours/day, 5 days/week)
- Peak hours: 8AM-4PM EST, Monday-Friday (160 hours/month)
- Off-peak hours: All other times (570 hours/month)
- Region: Oregon (us-west-2)
- Load Balancer: 25 requests per second

### Calculation
- AWS Fargate: **Note: A minimum of two tasks with 2 vCPU and 4GB of memory running during peak and off-peak hours for this architecture**
  - Peak Hours (160 hours):
    - vCPU: 2 tasks × 2 vCPU × 160 hours × $0.04048 = $25.91
    - Memory: 2 tasks × 4 GB × 160 hours × $0.004445 = $5.69
  - Off-Peak Hours (570 hours):
    - vCPU: 2 tasks × 2 vCPU × 570 hours × $0.04048 = $92.29
    - Memory: 2 tasks × 4 GB × 570 hours × $0.004445 = $20.27
  - Total: $118.20 + $25.96 = **$144.16/month**
- Load Balancer: 25 requests per second
  - $0.0225/hour = 730h * $0.0225 = $16.43/month
  - LCU cost: 1 LCU × $0.008 × 730 hours = $5.84/month
  - Total: $16.43 (Fixed) + $5.84 (LCU) = **$22.27/month**
- 2 NAT Gateways: $0.09/hour = 2 * (730h * $0.045) = **$65.70/month**
- Elasticache Serverless: $0.0084/hour = 730h * $0.0088 = **$6.45/month**
- EFS Costs: Minimum billing is 1GB per mount (2 mounts)
  - Total: 2GB × $0.08 per GB-month = **$0.16/month**
- RDS Aurora Serverless V2: 
  - **Base (always-on)**: 730 hours × 0.5 ACU × $0.12 = $43.80/month - Minimum capacity (ensures instant connections)
  - **Peak scaling**: 160 hours × 1.5 ACU × $0.12 = $28.80/month - Additional capacity during peak hours (scales from 0.5 to 2 ACU)
  - **Storage**: 10GB × $0.10 per GB = $1.00/month
  - **Baseline IO**: (730 hours × 3,600) × $0.0000002 = $0.53/month
  - Total: $43.80 + $28.80 + $1.00 + $0.53 = **$74.13/month**
  - *Note: min_capacity=0.5 ACU ensures the database is always available with instant connections (no 3-5 minute cold starts)*
- AWS Backup Costs:
  - Backup Storage Calculation: Daily backups (30 days): 0.005 GB × 30 = 0.15 GB Weekly backups (52 weeks): 0.005 GB × 52 = 0.26 GB Monthly backups (84 months/7 years): 0.005 GB × 84 = 0.42 GB Total backup storage: 0.83 GB
  - Warm storage (first 50TB): $0.05 per GB-month
    - Cost per month: 0.83 GB × $0.05 = $0.0415/month
  - Additional costs:
    - Backup API requests: $0.05 per 1,000 requests
    - 30 daily + 4 weekly + 1 monthly = ~35 backups per month
    - Cost: (35/1000) × $0.05 = $0.00175/month
  - Total AWS Backup Monthly Cost: **$0.05/month**
- 2 Secrets Manager Secrets: **$0.80/month**
- 1 WAF ACL with enhanced protection rules: **$5/month base + additional costs for managed rule groups**
  - Includes: AWS Managed Common Rule Set, SQL Injection Protection, Known Bad Inputs, Rate Limiting (2000 req/5min/IP), and Suspicious User-Agent blocking
- 1 KMS Key: **$1/month**
- **Total base cost: ~$320/month**

This works out to a base cost of $320/month. The true value of this architecture is its ability to rapidly autoscale and support even very large organizations. For smaller organizations you may want to consider looking at some of [OpenEMR's offerings in the AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/seller-profile?id=bec33905-edcb-4c30-b3ae-e2960a9a5ef4) which are more affordable.

**Note on Aurora Serverless v2 Pricing:** The database is configured with `min_capacity=0.5` ACU to ensure instant connections with no cold start delays. This adds ~$34/month to the base cost compared to scaling to zero, but provides 100% availability and eliminates 3-5 minute connection delays.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, you'll need:

1. **An AWS Account** - Sign up at https://aws.amazon.com/ (credit card required, but won't be charged until you use resources)
2. **AWS CLI** - Install from https://aws.amazon.com/cli/ (then run `aws configure` with your AWS credentials)
3. **Python 3.14** - Install from https://www.python.org/downloads/ (check "Add to PATH" during installation)
4. **Node.js** - Install from https://nodejs.org/ (download the LTS version)
5. **AWS CDK** - Install via `npm install -g aws-cdk` (requires Node.js)

> **Not sure how to install these?** See our [**Getting Started Guide**](GETTING-STARTED.md) which includes step-by-step installation instructions for each tool.

*For advanced setup options, see [DETAILS.md Instructions section](./DETAILS.md#instructions)*

## Quick Setup (~50 minutes)

> **First time deploying?** See [**GETTING-STARTED.md**](GETTING-STARTED.md) for detailed beginner-friendly instructions.

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Create a Python virtual environment (isolates this project's dependencies)
   python3 -m venv .venv
   
   # Activate the virtual environment
   # On Mac/Linux:
   source .venv/bin/activate
   # On Windows:
   .venv\Scripts\activate
   
   # Install required Python packages
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   
   **What is a virtual environment?** It's like a separate workspace for this project that keeps its dependencies isolated from other projects. You'll need to activate it (`source .venv/bin/activate`) each time you open a new terminal.

2. **Configure Access and Certificate**
   - Open `cdk.json` in a text editor
   - **Certificate (Required):** A certificate is required for HTTPS. Either:
     - Set `route53_domain` to your domain (e.g., `"example.com"`) for automated certificate management (recommended), or
     - Set `certificate_arn` to an existing ACM certificate ARN
   - **IP Access:** Find `security_group_ip_range_ipv4`
     - **For testing:** Leave as `"auto"` (automatically allows your current IP) or `"0.0.0.0/0"` (allows access from anywhere - not secure but convenient)
     - **For better security:** Change to your IP address, e.g., `"203.0.113.131/32"` (replace with your actual IP - find it at https://whatismyipaddress.com/)
   
   **Understanding the format:** `203.0.113.131/32` means "only allow this specific IP address". `0.0.0.0/0` means "allow any IP address". `"auto"` automatically detects and allows your current public IP.
   
   *For advanced configuration options, see [DETAILS.md Customizing Architecture Attributes](./DETAILS.md#customizing-architecture-attributes) and [HTTPS Setup Guide](./DETAILS.md#enabling-https-for-client-to-load-balancer-communication)*

3. **Validate Setup (Recommended)**
   ```bash
   # Check that everything is configured correctly
   ./scripts/validate-deployment-prerequisites.sh
   ```
   This verifies your AWS credentials, CDK setup, and configuration before deploying.

4. **Bootstrap CDK (First Time Only)**
   ```bash
   # One-time setup - tells AWS about CDK
   cdk bootstrap
   ```

5. **Deploy (~40 minutes)** 
   ```bash
   # Deploy OpenEMR to AWS
   cdk deploy
   ```
   
   CDK will show what it's creating and ask for confirmation. Type `y` to proceed. The deployment takes about 40 minutes - AWS is creating databases, networking, and other resources.

## Helper Scripts

This project includes several helper scripts in the `scripts/` directory:

### Pre-Deployment Validation

**`scripts/validate-deployment-prerequisites.sh`** - Validates your setup before deploying:
- Checks AWS CLI installation and credentials
- Verifies CDK installation and bootstrap status
- Validates Python dependencies
- Checks for existing stack status
- Validates CDK stack synthesis
- Checks Route53 hosted zone (if configured)

**Usage:**
```bash
# Can be run from project root or any subdirectory
./scripts/validate-deployment-prerequisites.sh
# or from scripts directory:
cd scripts && ./validate-deployment-prerequisites.sh
```

This script automatically detects the project root by searching for `cdk.json`, so it works from any subdirectory.

### CDK Stack Stress Testing

**`scripts/stress-test.sh`** - Tests CDK stack synthesis and optionally deployment/destruction with various configurations.

**Synthesis Testing (Default):**
```bash
./scripts/stress-test.sh
```
Tests stack synthesis with minimal, standard, and full-featured configurations without actually deploying.

**Full Deployment Testing:**
```bash
export DEPLOY_ACTUAL=true
./scripts/stress-test.sh
```
⚠️ **Warning:** This will actually deploy and destroy stacks, which takes ~40 minutes per configuration. Only use this if you want to stress test actual deployments.

### Load Testing

**`scripts/load-test.sh`** - Load tests the deployed OpenEMR application to verify performance under load.

**Basic Usage:**
```bash
# Load test with default settings (60s, 50 concurrent users, 100 RPS)
./scripts/load-test.sh OpenemrEcsStack

# Custom load test
export DURATION=120
export CONCURRENT_USERS=100
export REQUESTS_PER_SECOND=200
./scripts/load-test.sh OpenemrEcsStack
```

This script automatically:
- Retrieves the application URL from CloudFormation outputs
- Waits for the application to be ready
- Runs concurrent load tests and measures performance
- Reports success rate, response times (avg, median, P95, P99), and RPS

**Requirements:** Python 3 with `requests` library, AWS CLI configured, and a deployed stack.

See [scripts/README.md](scripts/README.md) for detailed usage and configuration options.

### Configuration Matrix Testing

Test all configuration combinations to ensure features work correctly:

**Python Test Script (Recommended):**
```bash
# Test all 8 configurations (minimal, standard, full-featured, with/without monitoring, etc.)
python3 scripts/test-cdk-synthesis.py

# Verbose output with detailed errors
python3 scripts/test-cdk-synthesis.py --verbose

# Stop on first failure
python3 scripts/test-cdk-synthesis.py --fail-fast
```

**Bash Stress Test:**
```bash
# Test 6 core configurations (synthesis only - fast)
./scripts/stress-test.sh

# Test actual deployment and destruction (slow - ~40 min per config)
export DEPLOY_ACTUAL=true
./scripts/stress-test.sh
```

**What's tested:**
- Minimal configuration (core features only)
- Standard configuration (Bedrock + Data API)
- Full-featured (Global Accelerator + Analytics)
- Monitoring alarms (SNS + CloudWatch)
- API and patient portal features
- CloudTrail logging

### Local Testing Scripts

- **`scripts/test-startup.sh`** - Test container startup locally without SSL
- **`scripts/test-startup-ssl.sh`** - Test container startup locally with SSL certificates

See [README-TESTING.md](README-TESTING.md) for detailed usage.
